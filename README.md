# Polynominal-sum-and-assign-
Define a structure called polynomial with following properties: - term_count stores number of terms the polynomial has. A polynomial can store a maximum of 10 terms.  - coefficients is an array of real values and stores each term’s coefficient value.  - exponents is an array of integer values and stores each term’s exponent value.  - coefficients and exponents are parallel arrays, i.e. coefficients[i] ∙ xexponents[i].  Write a function that sums two polynomials. int sum_polynomial(const polynomial_t*p, const polynomial_t*q, polynomial_t*r);  Write another function that assigns a polynomial to another polynomial. void assign_polynomial(polynomial_t*p, const polynomial_t*q);
